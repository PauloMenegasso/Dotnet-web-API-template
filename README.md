# DotNet-web-API-template

Hi folks,

This is a simple .bat script that creates a .NetCore API with separated layers following DDD archtechture.

The script also creates a test project and can install some basic nuget packages by default.

### Usage

Make sure you have the .NET SDK globally installed in your machine.

run the script at cmd by using the instructions

_C_sharp_new_api_base.bat yourProjectName_

that will create your project without any package installed.

If you wish to install the packages, simple add T T parameter at the command:

_C_sharp_new_api_base.bat yourProjectName T T_
